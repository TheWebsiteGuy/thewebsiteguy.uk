<p>This acceptable use policy governs your use of the services we provide (“Hosting Services”). Your use of the Hosting Services means that you accept, and agree to abide by, all the policies in this acceptable use policy, which supplement our terms and conditions. The Website Guy may modify this Acceptable Use Policy at any time without notice.</p>

<p>You must not allow a third party to access or use the Hosting Services. If you have purchased one of our reseller hosting packages, you can allow a third party (a “Third Party”) to access or use the Hosting Services. If you do so, they will also be regulated by this acceptable use policy. As such, you will monitor the use of the Hosting Services by a Third Party and you will procure that they abide by this acceptable use policy. A breach of this acceptable use policy by a Third Party will be deemed to be a breach of this acceptable use policy by you.</p>

<p>The Hosting Services are provided by Websites Studio Ltd (“we”, “us” and “our”). We are registered in England and Wales under company number 13294103 and we have our registered office at 85 Great Portland Street, London W1W 7LT.</p>

<p><strong>A. RESOURCE USAGE</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The Shared Hosting Services comprise the provision of web space on our servers to enable you to upload pages and files for the purpose of publishing websites.</li>
	<li>The Shared Hosting Services allow you ‘unlimited’ server space for normal routine “non-file-distribution” web usage. For websites that allow downloading of video, audio or other files we reserve the right to impose a bandwidth limit of two hundred and fifty (250) gigabytes per calendar month.</li>
	<li>Non-file-distribution usage will remain unaffected by any limit imposed on downloading of video, audio or other files.</li>
	<li>In your use of the Shared Hosting Services (other than where you are using your own virtual private server), you may not:
		<br>a. use more than 10% of our platform's processing capacity. There are numerous activities that could cause such problems, including (but not limited to) CGI scripts and intensive FTP, PHP or HTTP operations
		<br>b. run stand-alone, unattended server-side processes or any daemons; including (but not limited to) IRCd
		<br>c. run any type of web spider or indexer
		<br>d. run any software that interfaces with an Internet Relay Chat network

Therefore, all files uploaded to our servers as part of your usage of the Hosting Services must be visible and accessible to the outside world (web-visible) unless they are needed to operate the website of which they form part; We reserve the right to delete files or directories that are not web-visible without giving notice to you.</li>
	<li>All pages of website stored on our servers as part of the Hosting Services will be available to search engines unless you take action to prevent this. If you wish to optimise your web pages for search engines you agree to use coding and techniques which comply fully with the guidelines issued by Google, Bing, Yahoo and other large search engines.</li>
	<li>MySQL Databases are limited to 1024 megabytes in size, when they reach this size we will notify you.</li>
	<li>If you are a Reseller and deactivate a resold web hosting account we will delete it after 50 days.</li>
